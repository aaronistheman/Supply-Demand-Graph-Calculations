# Supply-Demand-Graph-Calculations

About
-----

This web-based personal project allos the user to graph supply and
demand
for the products of an industry. The user will also
be able to apply settings (e.g. an excise tax) and to see calculations
(e.g. consumer surplus, deadweight loss).
I am working on it during the March and (after a delay) June of 2016,
towards the end of my first year at UC Davis.

I will make it with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, and QUnit.

All that I currently know about economics is from two AP Economics classes
I took a year ago in high school. Thus, there are certain situations in
which I suspect I did not do the right thing. (e.g. Setting the world
price above the domestic equilibrium price does nothing in the program.
However, regarding real life, I suspect that
doing so could increase domestic supply, but this scenario was not
covered in the AP curriculum.)

Admittedly, the code is a little messy, mainly because I let the Graph
custom type become too big.

Features
--------

AngularJS is used to only show the user the options that make sense
(e.g. if the user does not check the box for "Government", then he/she
will not be asked where the price floor is).
