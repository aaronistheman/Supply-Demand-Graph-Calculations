# Supply-Demand-Graph-Calculations

About
-----

This web-based personal project will allow the user to graph supply and
demand
for the products of a firm, an industry, or a country. The user will also
be able to apply settings (e.g. an excise tax) and to see calculations
(e.g. consumer surplus, deadweight loss).

I am working on it during the March and April of 2016, towards the
beginning of my spring quarter of my first year at UC Davis.

I will make it with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, probably with the
help of jQuery, AngularJS, and/or QUnit.

Use of Git Hooks

To prevent trailing whitespace, I've enabled the pre-commit Git hook.
However, this change can't be saved in the repository. To make this
change, navigate to the directory .git/hooks, and rename "pre-commit.sample"
to "pre-commit".
