DON'T FORGET UNIT TESTS AND MULTIPLE BRANCHES

Next:
-add text fields and text boxes for options that are not always present;
requires AngularJS (use data-ng, not ng)
  -mentioned AngularJS in readme
  -use data-ng-disabled or data-ng-if or data-ng-switch
-determine a better way to decide how to orient the graphs (that is,
a better way than slope, which could be difficult for the user to understand)
-graph supply and demand
  -use ng-change to check of way to decide how to orient the graphs is
  being changed (so can redraw the graph)
  
Eventually:
-allow graphing of firm or aggregate
  -could use AngularJS if possible
  -could change the fields shown (in response to what the user wants
  to graph) (perhaps with AJAX or PHP or ASP or something)
-using tables to more neatly present the calculated data
-use AngularJS to note errorneous text field inputs
