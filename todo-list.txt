Next:
-finish moving world price handler
  -"user error" message if user gives world price that would cause
  extrapolation of at least one curve
    -the error messages should be in the controller, but the
    restoration should be in the model
    -perhaps make this clearer by displaying the current world price
    somewhere: display it before the "update" text box
-static Price.forDisplay() for display ep
-replace "data" variable name with "economyModel"?
-tests: indicate non-static-ness correctly (i.e. with "prototype")
-closing economy handler
-transfer any remains of (old) main.js and graph.js
-settings
  -see Note #1
-hi-liting controller
  -point value is highlighted (e.g. quantity demanded): perhaps show
  with a line on the canvas
  -area value is highlighted (e.g. deadweight loss): color the area
-end
  -robustly test with variety of supply and demand data, including
  ones that make non-monotonic graphs
  -where to say what industry it is?
  -make sure these are done
    -getNumberImports()
    -getDeadweightLoss()
    -getTaxRevenue()
  -at some point, getTotalRevenue() MUST be
  changed, since total revenue = price x QD
  -figure out if where I initially set up qd and qs is best
  -make sure correct state is shown if disequilibrium
  -make sure everything is put in correct folder
    -should constants.js be in utility?
    -why are Quantity and Price in the utility folder?
    -adjust tests if needed
  -the maxes seem a little deceptive, since they are not visible
  due to the label offset
  -have some context wrapper custom type so I don't have to keep
  putting the width and height in
  -should there be a version of update() that only updates
  specific fields, or would the time saved be too insignificant
  compared to the time to make it work
    -ideas
      -"update filters"
  -when (if ever) to implement the other part of getEconomicSurplus()?
    -erase alert in it at some point
  -remove Graph custom type and usage of it
  -describe the use of MVC in the readme

Note #1:
-remaining calculations/actions:
  -open, private economy
  -closed, public economy
    -(excise) tax or subsidy on supply:
      -location of "active supply"
        -somehow indicate the new D or new S; ideas on how:
          -different colors
        -make sure total revenue uses quantity demanded
      -recalculate:
        -equilibrium
        -total revenue
        -welfare
      -calculate
        -tax revenue
        -deadweight loss
    -(sales?) tax or subsidy on demand:
      -location of "active demand"
      -recalculate:
        -equilibrium
        -welfare
      -calculate
        -tax revenue
        -deadweight loss
    -price mechanism:
      -dashed line for where mechanism is
      -floor or ceiling:
        -recalculate (if equilibrium isn't reached):
          -mark that equilibrium isn't reached
          -total revenue
          -welfare
        -calculate
          -deadweight loss
  -open, public economy
    -tariff
      -recalculate:
        -welfare
      -calculate:
        -deadweight loss (in an unexpected area)
        -number of imports
        -tariff revenue
    -import quota
      -recalculate:
        -welfare
      -calculate:
        -deadweight loss (in an unexpected area)
        -number of imports (given)
        -tariff revenue N/A

Eventually:
-graph input
  -pick a way to get user's input to make the graph;
    -ideas regarding how to get the input:
      -have user paste them in certain format in text field
      -read from file, if possible with just JavaScript/jQuery
    -ideas regarding the input itself:
      -perhaps have it be specified there what is being graphed
      -get the maxes from the inputs
  -graph/input warnings/errors
    -if any calculation's integration goes past the final data point
    of the graph whose final data point's x-coordinate is lowest,
    then the graphs don't interact, and this should be said
    -report error if no semi-colon where expected one
    -if world price causes a quantity to go beyond lowest or highest
-use AngularJS to note errorneous text field inputs
  -e.g. price floor or ceiling has to matter
-(if not done yet) clean up script.js
-mention the format of the input strings in readme
-when hover over some measurement (e.g. producer surplus), hi lite
(on a separate canvas in the stack) the regarded region
-have workarounds for calculations that reach the boundaries of the
supply or demand points

Considerable:
-look into AJAX, just in case it can help somehow
-allow graphing of firm or aggregate
  -could use AngularJS if possible
  -could change the fields shown (in response to what the user wants
  to graph) (perhaps with AJAX or PHP or ASP or something)
-can probably afford to lower number of Riemann rectangles
-option to save applied inputs and apply them later
  -could use MongoDB and Node.js for this
-allow the panels to be in more than one column; see how it was done with
CSS in one of the card games
-using tables to more neatly present the calculated data
-see if is way to keep data in elements removed by ng-if
  -could use JavaScript/jQuery and, when ng-if creates an element,
  somehow react to the change to give the appropriate input fields
  their former values
-limit each text field's size?
  -or would this require too much assuming about the data?
-when change is made, hi lite the fields that changed, and have
a button to clear the hi lites
