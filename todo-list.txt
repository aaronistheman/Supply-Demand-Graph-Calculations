Next:
-remaining calculations/actions:
  -open, private economy: DONE
  -closed, public economy
    -subsidy/tax on supply/demand:
      -perhaps move some specific input methods into sample-graphs.js,
      in case I want to reuse them
      -figure out which cases have been tested, and see if they
      conform sufficiently to the notes below (put DONE in front
      if so)
      -tests for (all these values should be recalculated):
        (
        -NOTE: should be done for each of the following:
          -1) subsidy on demand
          -2) tax on demand
          -3) subsidy on supply
          -4) tax on supply
          -5) simple mixes; e.g.
            -tax and subsidy on demand
            -tax on supply; subsidy on demand
          -6) a few complicated mixes? (list some here)
        -NOTE: don't just use tests that have linear graphs
        -NOTE: look at cases in which rounding matters
        )
        -domestic equilibrium
        -quantity demanded/supplied
        -domestic total revenue
          -make sure the method does this right
            -always use quantity demanded? or should the minimum
            of QD and QS be used?
        -consumer/producer surplus (tests that don't have the
        previously encountered problem); total surplus?
        -deadweight loss (should be zero; only price mechanism
        and tariff/quota cause deadweight loss?
          -already has skeleton
        -tax revenue
          -method already has skeleton
      -PROBLEM: somewhere along the line, equilibrium quantity
      isn't properly updated
        -BIGGER PROBLEM: I'm no longer able to reproduce this problem.
      -SUGGESTION: think of some way to ensure the correct things get updated
        -don't be afraid to use another custom type or two
      -either fix getConsumerSurplus() now or later
        -there might be commented out tests to make note of
      -DELETE THIS NOTE?:
      [accessing to supply's points should apply the offset
        -apply correct offset to getP():
          -cs <-- SEEMS DONE
          -ps <-- SEEMS DONE
          -equil (x4)]
      -DELETE THIS NOTE?: [-how to find location of "active supply":
        -add or subtract from supply, but when? ideas:
          -when the change is realized, go through all supply points
          -have a method that returns an active supply value that
          finds the supply point then applies tax/subsidy to it]
      -user's offset
        -is the user's given offset rounded?
          -should it be?
        -should all offsets be allowed?
      -finishing touches
        -fix default controller values
    -price mechanism: (see the commit in which the todo list was detailed
    for the subsidy/taxation)
      -dashed line for where mechanism is
      -floor or ceiling:
        -recalculate (if equilibrium isn't reached):
          -mark that equilibrium isn't reached
          -total revenue
          -welfare
        -calculate
          -deadweight loss
    -if user privatizes economy or opens economy; disable:
      -tax
      -subsidy
      -price mechanism
  -open, public economy
    -tariff
      -recalculate:
        -welfare
      -calculate:
        -deadweight loss (in an unexpected area)
        -number of imports
        -tariff revenue
    -import quota
      -recalculate:
        -welfare
      -calculate:
        -deadweight loss (in an unexpected area)
        -number of imports (given)
        -tariff revenue N/A
-hi-liting controller
  -point value is highlighted (e.g. quantity demanded): perhaps show
  with a line on the canvas
  -area value is highlighted (e.g. deadweight loss): color the area
-end (also see "Eventually" section)
  -see if any parts of the program (that could be done more than
  once) take too long
    -ideas for improving speed:
      -replace ng-show/hide with ng-if, and just reapply event handlers
      when appropriate
  -robustly test with variety of supply and demand data, including
  ones that make non-monotonic graphs
  -where to say what industry it is?
  -make sure these are done
    -getNumberImports()
    -getDeadweightLoss()
    -getTaxRevenue()
  -at some point, getTotalRevenue() MUST be
  changed, since total revenue = price x QD
  -figure out if where I initially set up qd and qs is best
  -make sure correct state is shown if disequilibrium
  -make sure everything is put in correct folder
    -should constants.js be in utility?
    -why are Quantity and Price in the utility folder?
    -adjust tests if needed
  -the maxes seem a little deceptive, since they are not visible
  due to the label offset
  -have some context wrapper custom type so I don't have to keep
  putting the width and height in
  -should there be a version of update() that only updates
  specific fields, or would the time saved be too insignificant
  compared to the time to make it work
    -ideas
      -"update filters"
  -when (if ever) to implement the other part of getEconomicSurplus()?
    -erase alert in it at some point
  -remove Graph custom type and usage of it
  -describe the use of MVC in the readme

Eventually:
-graph input
  -pick a way to get user's input to make the graph;
    -ideas regarding how to get the input:
      -have user paste them in certain format in text field
      -read from file, if possible with just JavaScript/jQuery
    -ideas regarding the input itself:
      -perhaps have it be specified there what is being graphed
      -get the maxes from the inputs
  -graph/input warnings/errors
    -if any calculation's integration goes past the final data point
    of the graph whose final data point's x-coordinate is lowest,
    then the graphs don't interact, and this should be said
    -report error if no semi-colon where expected one
  -read "what is graphed" from file
-use AngularJS to note errorneous text field inputs
  -e.g. price floor or ceiling has to matter
-(if not done yet) clean up script.js
-mention the format of the input strings in readme
-when hover over some measurement (e.g. producer surplus), hi lite
(on a separate canvas in the stack) the regarded region
-have workarounds for calculations that reach the boundaries of the
supply or demand points

Considerable:
-look into AJAX, just in case it can help somehow
-allow graphing of firm or aggregate
  -could use AngularJS if possible
  -could change the fields shown (in response to what the user wants
  to graph) (perhaps with AJAX or PHP or ASP or something)
-can probably afford to lower number of Riemann rectangles
-option to save applied inputs and apply them later
  -could use MongoDB and Node.js for this
-allow the panels to be in more than one column; see how it was done with
CSS in one of the card games
-using tables to more neatly present the calculated data
-limit each text field's size?
  -or would this require too much assuming about the data?
-when change is made, hi lite the fields that changed, and have
a button to clear the hi lites
-replace "data" variable name with "economyModel"
-reapply settings when apply-able (e.g. if user opens economy, apply
the last used world price)
